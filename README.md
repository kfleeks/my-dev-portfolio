# My Personal Website

I built this single-page website for myself using React.js. Users can view the site [here.](https://www.jamesopara.dev)

## Contents

This website is divided into four sections. The header, about me, resume, and projects.

## Future Plans

I plan to expand on it as my skills and experience grow, and I will do my best to update the website as I build more projects.
